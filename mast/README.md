# MAST-EYEPIECE

Use [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/) to query a circular region on the sky
around a given object taken from the [TIC](https://tess.mit.edu/science/tess-input-catalogue/) catalog
keeping object only within the [GAIA](https://www.gaia-eso.eu/) survey

Use `eyepiece` to produce a telescope image of the region of the sky under set observing conditions.
